Questionnaires
==============

The Practices Survey Platform (DjaoPSP) is built for:

- Assessments managed by trade associations to create annual
  State-of-the-Industry reports.
- Sustainability questionnaire suppliers are typically asked to fill in
  alongside a Request For Proposal/Bid/Information (RFP/RFB/RFI/RFx)
  during sourcing events.

As a result, the Practices Survey Platform gives an opportunity to complete
the same questionnaire multiple times, each time creating a frozen record
at the date of completion. Completed (frozen) responses can be shared with
third-parties such as customers, investors, or general stakeholders.

Respondents also have the ability to answer in multiple strides. Other
users can review a current assessment and add their input.


The Practices Survey Platform supports:

- Sections and sub-sections to organize questions logically
- Optionally scored responses through a derivative
  of `djaopsp.scores.base.ScoreCalculator`.
- Qualitative and quantitative answers
  (see `djaodjin-survey <https://djaodjin-survey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/encoding.html>`_)
- Required and optional answers
